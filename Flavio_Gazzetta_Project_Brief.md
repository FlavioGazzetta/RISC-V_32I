## Overview  

During my time working on this project I initially devoted my work towards working on both the single cycle and especially a 5 stage pipelined CPU. For the single-cycle I made and tested various componets, these components were the DataMemory, the Register file, the ALU, the PC and various multiplexers. After having completed this I focused my time on the pipelining cpu for which I made many new components including a hazard unit (would decide when to flush, stall and use forwarding), hazard multiplexers (to implement forwarding), registers which would separate the stages Fetch->Decode, Decode->Execute, Execute->Memory, Memory->WriteBack, a mux which would allow the implementation of the JALR instruction and many more.
